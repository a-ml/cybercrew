# Comprehensive Threat Intelligence Report for Alerts Analysis

## Executive Summary
In our analysis of critical events, IOCs, TTPs, and recommendations related to Event IDs 1720683876.36633 and 1720683878000, we discovered that these alerts were false positives triggered by the Zeek network security monitor tool. We conducted thorough research using threat feeds, security publications, dark web, and OSINT sources to provide a comprehensive analysis of the events. Our report is organized into sections for easy understanding and actionable insights.

## Overview
Event IDs 1720683876.36633 and 1720683878000 were related to files owned by root and having written permissions for anyone, which could potentially lead to security issues. However, upon investigation, it was determined that these alerts were false positives triggered by the Zeek network security monitor tool. The tool is designed to monitor network activity and detect potential threats, but in this case, it raised false alarms.

## Actor Profiles
No specific actors were identified in relation to these events as they were determined to be false positives.

## Analysis
1. **Correlation with Known Threats:** There was no direct correlation found between the false positive alerts and known threats or malicious actors. The alerts were generated due to the configuration of the Zeek tool, which is a legitimate security monitoring system.
2. **Vulnerabilities Assessment:** Although the files in question had permissions that could potentially lead to security issues, they were part of the Zeek network security monitor tool and not a potential threat. No vulnerabilities were identified as exploitable by malicious actors.
3. **Mitigations Evaluation:** To avoid such false positives in the future, we recommend assessing the security posture of the environment, reviewing alert policies and criteria, verifying any changes made to related files or configurations, maintaining vigilance on these types of alerts, collaborating with other security teams, and documenting the investigation findings in a detailed Markdown report.

## Recommendations
1. Assess the security posture of the environment and ensure that appropriate controls are in place.
2. Review alert policies and criteria to avoid future false positives.
3. Verify any changes made to related files or configurations to maintain the integrity of the monitoring system.
4. Maintain vigilance on these types of alerts to prevent similar false positives in the future.
5. Collaborate with other security teams to share insights and best practices.
6. Document the investigation findings in a detailed Markdown report for future reference.

## Conclusion
The critical events (Event IDs 1720683876.36633 and 1720683878000) were determined to be false positives triggered by the Zeek network security monitor tool. By following our recommendations, organizations can ensure that their monitoring systems are operating effectively and efficiently, minimizing the risk of false alarms and maintaining a strong security posture.
