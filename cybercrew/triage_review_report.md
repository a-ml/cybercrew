The critical alerts (Event IDs 1720683876.36633 and 1720683878000) are related to files owned by root and having written permissions for anyone, which can potentially lead to security issues. However, after analyzing the context and investigating the mentioned files, it appears that they are part of the Zeek network security monitor tool and are not a potential security threat. These alerts seem to be false positives triggered by the monitoring system. To avoid such false positives in the future, assess the security posture of the environment, review alert policies and criteria, verify any changes made to related files or configurations, maintain vigilance on these types of alerts, collaborate with other security teams, and document the investigation findings in a detailed Markdown report.
