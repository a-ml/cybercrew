      "In his influential book The Great Transformation (1944), Karl Polanyi argued that an essential task for understanding capitalism was to appreciate how it had fundamentally altered human social relations. His argument is still relevant today but has largely been neglected as mainstream political economy focused on its neoclassical formulation, which sees markets primarily as the means of coordinating production through exchange.\n",
      "Polanyi’s central point was that capitalism transformed society by creating what he called “disembedded” relations – in other words, by taking out aspects from human social relations and making them independent entities operating within a framework set up largely around market activity (see Polanyi 1944). The result was dislocation of the traditional structures through which people had previously related to each other.\n",
      "This idea can be illustrated using an example taken from my own research on smallholder farmers in Burkina Faso, West Africa. As part of their livelihoods, most farmers grow some crops for sale and others to consume at home – a process that is often referred to as “dual-purpose” production. In the past, when food security was ensured primarily by subsistence agriculture with small quantities being sold or bartered, access to land did not rely on market transactions but rather on existing social relations of kinship and reciprocity.\n",
      "In this context, farmers would be more likely to ask for help from their neighbours than they were to try negotiating a price (Molle 2015). However, the transformation that Polanyi refers to has meant that many aspects of human social relations have become dependent on market activity: in the Burkina Faso example I mentioned above, when farmers decide to grow more crops for sale they face constraints from their access to land. If this is a private plot (as opposed to communal or state-owned), then it can only be accessed if rents are paid to the owner. These payments of rent mean that relationships between individuals have become dependent on market activity.\n",
      "Another example relates to farmers’ livelihoods becoming more reliant on cash income as their ability to produce food for subsistence purposes declines due to factors such as climate change and population growth (Molle 2 Sitzmeier & Ziegler 2014). However, in order to earn the money they need to pay these renters – or for any other purpose – farmers have become reliant on selling their crops at a market where prices are determined by competition. As such, relationships between producers and consumers also become disembedded as farmers have little control over how much income they earn from producing food (Molle 2015).\n",
      "The implications of this transformation go beyond the economic sphere; in many instances it can lead to social problems arising out of market activity. A recent example is the “Land Grabbing Crisis” that has affected several countries across Africa and Asia, including Burkina Faso (Kanayama 2014). In this crisis, foreign companies have been purchasing large swathes of land for commercial agriculture with the aim of exporting produce back to their home markets. The process is often undertaken without consultation from local communities and in many cases involves violations of human rights (Kanayama 2014).\n",
      "However, this phenomenon does not just occur as an isolated event; it fits into a broader pattern whereby the interests and livelihoods of people become disembedded. In addition to land grabbing, there are many cases in which market activity has contributed to conflicts between individuals or communities (for example on water resources). A recent report from Oxfam suggests that “the current neoliberal approach […] is causing more harm than good for the world’s poorest people” (Oxfam 2018, p.74) by encouraging such dislocation of social relations in order to maximise profit and efficiency within market activity.\n",
      "For Polanyi this transformation represents a key turning point that brought about capitalism as we know it today. However, his work is often criticised for being too general and lacking sufficient focus on the political dimension (e.g. Marx 1978). While this may be true to an extent – I would argue that one of Polanyi’s key contributions was in demonstrating how far removed from pure economic theory capitalism actually is (Molle & Darnon, forthcoming) – it does not detract from the fact that he helped establish a new paradigm within political economy.\n",
      "That being said, there are many ways to take Polanyi’s insights forward in terms of research and policy. In addition to using his ideas as an entry point into studying how capitalism has changed social relations more generally (such as by considering the impact on gendered divisions of labour), I have argued that we should also consider these changes as a way of understanding current political problems, such as those related to land grabbing.\n",
      "To conclude, it is important for us not only to understand how capitalism has altered human social relations but also what this means in terms of the challenges we currently face. We need new solutions that do not rely on the continued expansion of markets if we are to address these issues and their far-reaching consequences.\n",

      "The World Bank has been promising to end world poverty since its founding in the aftermath of the Second World War. But it hasn’t yet managed this, despite being able to fund large-scale development projects for over seven decades.\n",
      "As a researcher who studies economic development and international relations, I think one reason why is because many people living in poverty don’t have access to financial services such as bank accounts or credit cards — an issue known as “financial exclusion”. And this puts them at higher risk of falling into poverty.\n",
      "Financial exclusion has been a persistent problem around the world, particularly among the poor and vulnerable in low-income countries like Ethiopia. Aside from being unable to access financial services that could help improve their lives or businesses, they are often left out of important information about public policy and national development plans, which means they also tend to be excluded from conversations around how these policies may impact them directly.\n",
      "My colleague Maddalena Mariani-Nemanic and I wanted to see if financial inclusion could play a role in helping people get involved with the democratic process by increasing their knowledge of political issues, especially important ones such as national elections. We recently published our findings on this topic in the journal Public Administration Review.\n",
      "What we found out was that even though having access to basic financial services can’t directly influence whether or not people vote, it could help them be more informed about who they are voting for and what issues matter most to their communities — ultimately helping voters become better citizens.\n",
      "Financial inclusion is the process of ensuring individuals have equal access to formal financial services that helps support savings, investment opportunities, insurance coverage, credit options and other financial needs such as paying utility bills or sending children to school. This includes bank accounts, credit cards and mobile money accounts — among others.\n",
      "Why is this important? In low-income countries like Ethiopia, access to these services has been limited due to factors including the lack of a strong regulatory framework for financial institutions, high transaction costs and insufficient technological infrastructure such as reliable electricity or internet connectivity. As a result, most people have never even opened a bank account — let alone gotten credit cards or mobile money accounts.\n",
      "This matters because being excluded from the formal economy can create barriers that make it difficult for poor households to plan and save for long-term goals such as education and retirement, which in turn increases their risk of falling into poverty. And financial inclusion could help close this gap by bringing more people into the system — though there’s still a lot of debate on whether or not this alone can significantly reduce global poverty rates.\n",
      "Our study focuses on one specific aspect: Can opening an account, getting access to credit and participating in mobile money services increase knowledge about national elections? We conducted two experiments involving 1,500 individuals — split equally between men and women aged 20 to 39 years old living in rural Ethiopia.\n",
      "One group received a basic bank account with no other financial products for free; another was offered an additional product (micro-credit or mobile money) alongside the basic account, while a third served as the control — meaning they didn’t receive any service at all. All participants were also given informational handouts about national elections to read and ask questions afterward.\n",
      "After three months of observation, we found that financial inclusion had no direct effect on whether people went out to vote or not during the 2015 Ethiopian general election (though this might have changed since then). But there was a statistically significant difference between those who were financially included and those excluded: The former group reported being better informed about national elections, particularly when compared with their counterparts in the control group.\n",
      "This suggests that financial inclusion can play an indirect role by giving people access to information they need for making important decisions — such as choosing political candidates or supporting specific policies like healthcare reform or infrastructure investments. As voters become more informed about what’s at stake with their votes, this may also help improve overall democratic participation and strengthen government accountability by encouraging citizens to speak up against corruption.\n",
      "Of course, financial inclusion alone cannot solve every issue related to poverty or political disenfranchisement — but it does appear to have an important role in helping individuals participate more effectively in their communities’ decision-making processes. And that could be crucial for creating a better future where everyone has the opportunity to thrive regardless of their socioeconomic status.\n",

      "In his influential book The Great Transformation (1944), Karl Polanyi argued that an essential task for understanding capitalism was to appreciate how it had fundamentally altered human social relations. His argument is still relevant today but has largely been neglected as mainstream political economy focused on its neoclassical formulation, which sees markets primarily as the means of coordinating production through exchange.\n",
      "Polanyi’s central point was that capitalism transformed society by creating what he called “disembedded” relations – in other words, by taking out aspects from human social relations and making them independent entities operating within a framework set up largely around market activity (see Polanyi 1944). The result was dislocation of the traditional structures through which people had previously related to each other.\n",
      "This idea can be illustrated using an example taken from my own research on smallholder farmers in Burkina Faso, West Africa. As part of their livelihoods, most farmers grow some crops for sale and others to consume at home – a process that is often referred to as “dual-purpose” production. In the past, when food security was ensured primarily by subsistence agriculture with small quantities being sold or bartered, access to land did not rely on market transactions but rather on existing social relations of kinship and reciprocity.\n",
      "In this context, farmers would be more likely to ask for help from their neighbours than they were to try negotiating a price (Molle 2015). However, the transformation that Polanyi refers to has meant that many aspects of human social relations have become dependent on market activity: in the Burkina Faso example I mentioned above, when farmers decide to grow more crops for sale they face constraints from their access to land. If this is a private plot (as opposed to communal or state-owned), then it can only be accessed if rents are paid to the owner. These payments of rent mean that relationships between individuals have become dependent on market activity.\n",
      "Another example relates to farmers’ livelihoods becoming more reliant on cash income as their ability to produce food for subsistence purposes declines due to factors such as climate change and population growth (Molle 2 Sitzmeier & Ziegler 2014). However, in order to earn the money they need to pay these renters – or for any other purpose – farmers have become reliant on selling their crops at a market where prices are determined by competition. As such, relationships between producers and consumers also become disembedded as farmers have little control over how much income they earn from producing food (Molle 2015).\n",
      "The implications of this transformation go beyond the economic sphere; in many instances it can lead to social problems arising out of market activity. A recent example is the “Land Grabbing Crisis” that has affected several countries across Africa and Asia, including Burkina Faso (Kanayama 2014). In this crisis, foreign companies have been purchasing large swathes of land for commercial agriculture with the aim of exporting produce back to their home markets. The process is often undertaken without consultation from local communities and in many cases involves violations of human rights (Kanayama 2014).\n",
      "However, this phenomenon does not just occur as an isolated event; it fits into a broader pattern whereby the interests and livelihoods of people become disembedded. In addition to land grabbing, there are many cases in which market activity has contributed to conflicts between individuals or communities (for example on water resources). A recent report from Oxfam suggests that “the current neoliberal approach […] is causing more harm than good for the world’s poorest people” (Oxfam 2018, p.74) by encouraging such dislocation of social relations in order to maximise profit and efficiency within market activity.\n",
      "For Polanyi this transformation represents a key turning point that brought about capitalism as we know it today. However, his work is often criticised for being too general and lacking sufficient focus on the political dimension (e.g. Marx 1978). While this may be true to an extent – I would argue that one of Polanyi’s key contributions was in demonstrating how far removed from pure economic theory capitalism actually is (Molle & Darnon, forthcoming) – it does not detract from the fact that he helped establish a new paradigm within political economy.\n",
      "That being said, there are many ways to take Polanyi’s insights forward in terms of research and policy. In addition to using his ideas as an entry point into studying how capitalism has changed social relations more generally (such as by considering the impact on gendered divisions of labour), I have argued that we should also consider these changes as a way of understanding current political problems, such as those related to land grabbing.\n",
      "To conclude, it is important for us not only to understand how capitalism has altered human social relations but also what this means in terms of the challenges we currently face. We need new solutions that do not rely on the continued expansion of markets if we are to address these issues and their far-reaching consequences.\n",

      "The World Bank has been promising to end world poverty since its founding in the aftermath of the Second World War. But it hasn’t yet managed this, despite being able to fund large-scale development projects for over seven decades.\n",
      "As a researcher who studies economic development and international relations, I think one reason why is because many people living in poverty don’t have access to financial services such as bank accounts or credit cards — an issue known as “financial exclusion”. And this puts them at higher risk of falling into poverty.\n",
      "Financial exclusion has been a persistent problem around the world, particularly among the poor and vulnerable in low-income countries like Ethiopia. Aside from being unable to access financial services that could help improve their lives or businesses, they are often left out of important information about public policy and national development plans, which means they also tend to be excluded from conversations around how these policies may impact them directly.\n",
      "My colleague Maddalena Mariani-Nemanic and I wanted to see if financial inclusion could play a role in helping people get involved with the democratic process by increasing their knowledge of political issues, especially important ones such as national elections. We recently published our findings on this topic in the journal Public Administration Review.\n",
      "What we found out was that even though having access to basic financial services can’t directly influence whether or not people vote, it could help them be more informed about who they are voting for and what issues matter most to their communities — ultimately helping voters become better citizens.\n",
      "Financial inclusion is the process of ensuring individuals have equal access to formal financial services that helps support savings, investment opportunities, insurance coverage, credit options and other financial needs such as paying utility bills or sending children to school. This includes bank accounts, credit cards and mobile money accounts — among others.\n",
      "Why is this important? In low-income countries like Ethiopia, access to these services has been limited due to factors including the lack of a strong regulatory framework for financial institutions, high transaction costs and insufficient technological infrastructure such as reliable electricity or internet connectivity. As a result, most people have never even opened a bank account — let alone gotten credit cards or mobile money accounts.\n",
      "This matters because being excluded from the formal economy can create barriers that make it difficult for poor households to plan and save for long-term goals such as education and retirement, which in turn increases their risk of falling into poverty. And financial inclusion could help close this gap by bringing more people into the system — though there’s still a lot of debate on whether or not this alone can significantly reduce global poverty rates.\n",
      "Our study focuses on one specific aspect: Can opening an account, getting access to credit and participating in mobile money services increase knowledge about national elections? We conducted two experiments involving 1,500 individuals — split equally between men and women aged 20 to 39 years old living in rural Ethiopia.\n",
      "One group received a basic bank account with no other financial products for free; another was offered an additional product (micro-credit or mobile money) alongside the basic account, while a third served as the control — meaning they didn’t receive any service at all. All participants were also given informational handouts about national elections to read and ask questions afterward.\n",
      "After three months of observation, we found that financial inclusion had no direct effect on whether people went out to vote or not during the 2015 Ethiopian general election (though this might have changed since then). But there was a statistically significant difference between those who were financially included and those excluded: The former group reported being better informed about national elections, particularly when compared with their counterparts in the control group.\n",
      "This suggests that financial inclusion can play an indirect role by giving people access to information they need for making important decisions — such as choosing political candidates or supporting specific policies like healthcare reform or infrastructure investments. As voters become more informed about what’s at stake with their votes, this may also help improve overall democratic participation and strengthen government accountability by encouraging citizens to speak up against corruption.\n",
      "Of course, financial inclusion alone cannot solve every issue related to poverty or political disenfranchisement — but it does appear to have an important role in helping individuals participate more effectively in their communities’ decision-making processes. And that could be crucial for creating a better future where everyone has the opportunity to thrive regardless of their socioeconomic status.\n",
